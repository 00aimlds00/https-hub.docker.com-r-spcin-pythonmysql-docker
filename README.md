Problem with port 3306 when trying to query from mysql table from inside docker
It is a small setup with a Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, app.py, init.sql and requirements.txt. What I want is to create the image (DONE) but
docker-compose up --build returns error at the end port 3306 error. I have tried withport 3307.
